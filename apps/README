monolith/apps directory

msp - monolith server pages
---------------------------

MSPs (".msp" files) are HTML files with additional mark-up. The main
benefit is that they allow you to embed working monolith widgets into
existing HTML pages.

The current implementation of MSPs should be regarded as very much
"version 0.1". We will probably rewrite it from scratch when we have
time to use something which looks a lot more like XML. However, the
current version is usable; indeed http://www.annexia.org/ is built
using MSPs.

The msp app contained in this directory is just a wrapper around the
ml_msp widget which can be found in the ../widgets/ directory. For
full documentation on writing MSP files, look at the new_ml_msp(3)
manual page.

To use MSPs, add the following to your /etc/rws/hosts/<hostname> file:

begin rewrite
^/(.*\.msp)$    /so-bin/msp.so?page=$1  last,qsa
^/$             /index.msp              qsa,external
^/(.*)/$        /$1/index.msp           qsa,external
end rewrite

msp root:       <document root directory>
msp database:   dbname=<name of the database>

stats - monolith statistics/debugging application
-------------------------------------------------

The stats interface allows you to browse around the internals of a
running rws/monolith server, displaying structures and updating them
in real time. It can be quite useful for debugging.

For security reasons, this application does not install itself by
default. You need to manually copy the stats.so file to
/usr/share/rws/so-bin, and make sure it is mode 0755. You should also
consider NOT installing this on live servers - at least until rws
supports access control. This is because the sensitive internal
information revealed by stats might make it easier for a cracker to
break into your system.

To run the stats application, point your browser at
http://yourhostname/so-bin/stats.so . It should be self-explanatory
from there on.
