Installing Monolith
-------------------

You first need to install the following components, in the order
listed below:

0. cdoc    from http://www.annexia.org/freeware/c2lib/ (optional)
1. c2lib   from http://www.annexia.org/freeware/c2lib/
2. pthrlib from http://www.annexia.org/freeware/pthrlib/
3. rws     from http://www.annexia.org/freeware/rws/

Make sure you have the latest versions of these packages. Older
versions may not work correctly.

Built it:

	./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
	make
	make check

Install it (as root):

	make install

You will now need to configure rws. The configuration files for rws
are normally located in the /etc/rws/ directory.

For the /etc/rws/rws.conf file, just use the example one supplied with
rws. You can modify it if you want, but I didn't.

Now create a /etc/rws/hosts/localhost file which should contain:

	alias /
	        # Path to the document root. NOTE you will
	        # definitely want to change this!
	        path:           /var/www
	        show:           1
	        list:           1
	end alias

	alias /so-bin/
	        path:           /usr/local/share/monolith/so-bin
	        exec so:        1
	end alias

	alias /ml-styles/
	        path:           /usr/local/share/monolith/ml-styles
	        show:           1
	end alias

These are the default locations for the files if you installed
Monolith with --prefix=/usr/local, but you may need to change these if
you installed with another prefix.

Create symbolic links as necessary to your localhost file:

	cd /etc/rws/hosts
	ln -s localhost:8080 localhost
	ln -s www.example.com localhost

etc.

Now, start up rws (as root, of course):

	/usr/local/sbin/rwsd -C /etc/rws -p 8080

Fire up a browser and point it at

	http://localhost:8080/so-bin/01_label_and_button.so

Errors will be displayed in the error log (/tmp/error_log or
/var/log/httpd/error_log).

If the button doesn't appear as a white square surrounded by a black
rectangle, then the stylesheet is not being found. Make sure you set
up the /ml-styles/ alias correctly.

Monolith installs other example programs. Look in the examples/
directory for a full list.
