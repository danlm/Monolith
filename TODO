Known bugs:

* Fix bug with updating value fields on submit buttons.

Desirable widgets and features:

* Radios built from toggle buttons.

* Tabs and tabbed panes.
  
* True links (looking like buttons or URLs?) [note: can be emulated now
  using ml_button and redirects -- perhaps an ml_link_button class to
  wrap this up?]
  
* Menubar, menus, menu items.

* File open (this will have to have a fairly flexible VFS layer since
  it obviously can't access local disk)

* Iframe or object (?)

* Fixed placement layout exposing more positioning features of CSS2

* Popup menus (if these are possible)

* Themes

* Buttons should have: [IMG] Text (with IMG being optional) so that
  we can style them differently if desired.

* User authentication in a more integrated manner.

* Update documentation to cover recent changes to the API
